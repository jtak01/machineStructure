No additional help required 

No significant departures from initial design

Correctly implemented all aspects of homework:
Program is able to load and execute instructions for
"Universal Machine" and executes in an appropriate
amount of time

Design
um.c: UM program. Uses execute and loader to emulate an Universal Machine.
um_exec.c: Program that is used by the UM to execute different computations.
um_load.c: Program that is used by UM and is required to execute.
           This will extract the instructions from the given .um file.
seg.c: Manages the segmented memory that is used by the um.


TESTS:
add.um - Tests add operations
div.um - Tests division operations
halt.um - Tests halt operation
mul.um - Tests multiply operation
print-six.um - Tests different operations and prints "6" at the end
nand.um - Tests bitwise nand (output of this test should be 4261412864)
	NOTE: this was tested by outputting values interms of unsigned instead 
	of char ("%u") just so that we can check the math was correct



Time to Execute 50 million instructions: 11,292 seconds approximatley

5 hours analyzing
10 hours designing
5 hours solving problems
