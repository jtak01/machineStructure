We have accounted for every error and case the hw spec mentions and that we
could come up with on our own.

When valgrinding simlines, there is a "still reachable" leak that valgrind
accredits to Atom_string/Atom_new, we have been informed by multiple TAs that
this memory leak is okay and we do not need to account for it.
