/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:467:     When the flames burnt his book, to drinking he took,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:474:     When disturbed by the Crows, he abruptly arose,

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:635:     He rushed down the Strand with a Pig in each hand,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:63:     So he made them a Book, and with laughter they shook
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:656:     But he screeched to his Wife, and she said, "Oh, my life!
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:691:     When they said, "How d' ye do?" he replied, "Who are you?"
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:698:     And when he was found, they said he was drowned,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:733:     He fed them on Snails, and weighed them in scales,

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:789:     When he found he grew stiff, he jumped over the cliff,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:796:     He built a balloon to examine the moon,

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:817:     He sat on a rail, and imbibed bitter ale,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:824:     When they said, "Sir, you'll fall!" he replied, "Not at all!"
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/6/4/13646/13646.txt:831:     But to make it more nice, he inserted some Mice,

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:128: at everything; he has grace and originality, two rare qualities because

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:134: in a manner that embarrassed her; then he left her and did not speak to

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:149: Eugene was, by this time, writing letters. He was comfortably seated,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:152: griffins of a fender, and to think of our love in our dressing-gown is
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:156: The first letter which Eugene wrote was soon finished; he folded and

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:165: He crossed the two flaps of his flowered dressing-gown, put his feet
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:169: degrees. He stopped drinking tea and remained motionless, his eyes fixed
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:171: seeing either hand or shovel. He ceased even to poke the fire,--a vast

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:199: He took up the two letters, directed them, and rang for his servant.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/7/1373/1373.txt:201: "Take these," he said, "and deliver them."

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:209: then went through into the field. He then followed a winding path until
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:210: he came to the edge of the trees, and there stopped to listen.

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:226: he should get over. The brook was pretty wide and deep.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:228: Jonas said, if he would wait a few minutes, he would build him a

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:302: then he could go over more easily.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:307: He held on with one hand, and carried his hatchet in the other. Then he

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:321: Rollo said he did not, and then Jonas told him to do exactly as he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:326: Rollo felt in his pockets in vain, but he recollected his little parcel,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:340: All this time, Jonas was at work in the bushes, at a little distance. He
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:352: But Rollo could not understand how he could make a house so.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:359: a little, and then he fixed it down in one of these holes, in such a
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:361: then he went back to his work, leaving Rollo to go on with the wigwam.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:370: delighted at seeing it gradually begin to look like a house, when he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:371: thought he heard a voice. He listened a moment, and heard some one at a

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:375: came from, and called out as loud as he could, "What!"
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:380: bridge, and ran through the woods until he came out into the open field;
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:381: and there he saw a small boy, away off at a distance, just coming
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:395: "What a beautiful little eagle!" said Rollo, as he looked at one side of
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:404: James said he thought he could get it off; so they went and sat down on
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:406: on the log. Then he took a pin, and tried to drive the point of it under
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:410: "Never mind," said Rollo; "I will keep it as it is." So he took his half
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:414: get the eagle off. He smiled at this. The boys went back soon to the
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:415: wigwam, and James said he would help Rollo finish it. While they were at
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:444: So saying, he went to the side towards Jonas, and began to take away a
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:450: So he took hold of the branch that Rollo had hold of. They both felt
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:477: The boys both preferred that he should settle it, and promised to do as
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:478: he should say.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:480: "Well, then," said he, "the first thing is for you, Rollo, to go over
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:497: _yours_. He began it without you, and was going on without you, and when
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:499: to have let him do as he wished with his own wigwam. You were unjust."

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:524: do. Jonas told them, when they went away, that he expected that they
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:525: would have another quarrel, as he perceived that their hearts were still
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:540: "No, he did not," replied James. "He blamed you the most; he said you

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:547: he, stretching up his hand.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:550: higher than James did; for he was a little taller.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:552: James was somewhat vexed to find that Rollo could reach higher than he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:556: so he took up a stick, and reached it up in the air as high as he could,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:568: stone, and his cap prevented it from hurting him much; but he was
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:569: already vexed and out of humor, and so he began to cry out aloud.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:571: Rollo was frightened a little, for he was afraid he had hurt his cousin
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:572: a good deal, and then he expected too that Jonas would come. But Jonas
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:575: hurt. But this time, he knew by the tone of James's crying, that it was
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:579: in a few minutes, as he happened to look round, his eye rested on the
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:580: stone where they had put their half dollars, and he saw that only one of
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:583: "O, Rollo," said he, "one of our half dollars is gone."
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:588: he believed James had taken it, and James charged it upon Rollo. Then
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:590: was his; he said he remembered _exactly_ how his looked; and Rollo knew
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:597: he _knew_ the one that was left was his, for he remembered exactly how
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:598: it looked, and he also remembered exactly the very spot on the stone
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:599: where he put it down.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:601: James did not mean to tell a lie, but he was a little angry and excited,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:607: "Which half dollar was it," said he, "that you tried to get the eagle
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:615: what he would say.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:623: James stood still a minute, thinking, presently he said,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:638: of the pieces of money into the water. So he walked up to it and looked
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:641: In a minute or two, he pointed down, and the boys looked and saw
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:646: "I believe it is," said Jonas. Jonas then took off his jacket, rolled up
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:648: the water, but it was a little too deep. He could not reach it.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:650: "I cannot get it so," said he.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:657: He then sat down on the rock and looked into the water. "We can go home
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:659: he.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:661: "O, yes," said Rollo, "I will go and get them;" and he ran off towards
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:666: So he went and cut a long straight stem of a bush, and trimmed it up
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:667: smooth, and cut the largest end off exactly square. Then he went to a
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:669: "sticky." He pressed some of this with his knife on the end of the
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/9/1/9/19195/19195.txt:670: stick. Then he reached it very carefully down, and pressed it hard

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:194: consider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted for
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:195: a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:197: first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:210: near enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, "All
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:253: And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:257: rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:258: was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:259: the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:271: in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:273: muleteers blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until he had

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:281: unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after having been
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:282: thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himself
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:284: mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse. However,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:285: battered in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:295: Finding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:302: exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a show of severe
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:303: suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:312: And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:317: As chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:319: with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:320: came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:321: that he complained so dolefully.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:324: uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:325: he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor's son
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:329: the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face, which
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:330: was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:331: and said, "Senor Quixada" (for so he appears to have been called when he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:336: Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:337: backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:338: any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, and
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:341: splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by the
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:342: bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:345: Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:346: sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:347: so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:349: match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:352: when the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:354: gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read the story in the "Diana"
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:356: so aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:357: listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:379: miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:380: the village and went to Don Quixote's house, which he found all in
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:387: true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:390: he would turn knight-errant and go all over the world in quest of
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:397: after which he would fling the book away and snatch up his sword and fall
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:398: to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he would say he had
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:400: when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received in
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:401: battle; and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:406: come to this pass, and burn all these accursed books--for he has a great
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:414: All this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:447: nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:46: OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:52: to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:53: to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:54: all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:56: well qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:58: of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:61: He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:62: come feeble cries as of some one in distress, and the instant he heard
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:63: them he exclaimed, "Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:67: and protection;" and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:68: whence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/0/5904/5904.txt:69: wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:107: of the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason to dread, resolved to
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:115: prize that was no good either to pledge or sell. While Sancho slept he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:116: stole his ass, and before day dawned he was far out of reach.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:119: Sancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was missing, and seeing

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:127: Don Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:128: Sancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:130: ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho took comfort at
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:132: kindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part was rejoiced to the
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:134: place for the adventures he was in quest of. They brought back to his
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:136: solitudes and wilds, and he went along reflecting on these things, so
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:137: absorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anything
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:140: Nor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in a

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:150: were needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pike he was
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:155: chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition he was able to see
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:157: of linen no less curious than clean; and in a handkerchief he found a
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:158: good lot of gold crowns, and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed:
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:163: Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:166: of its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering the

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:183: hear it, he found that it ran as follows:
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:187: Or Love is lacking in intelligence,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:191: But if Love be a God, it follows thence

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:210: of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and, faith, he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:232: "From the beginning it seems to be a love letter," replied Don Quixote.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:235: of love matters."
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:238: requested him, he found it ran thus:
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:251: When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, "There is less to be

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:254: he found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:255: others he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:259: pad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:263: hundred; and though he found no more booty, he held the blanket flights,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:265: alforjas, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and weariness he had
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:266: endured in the service of his good master, cheap at the price; as he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:267: considered himself more than fully indemnified for all by the payment he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:273: he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:277: chose--which was where he could make his way--firmly persuaded that among
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:278: these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure. As he went
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:279: along, then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:282: he could make out he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:287: He was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:289: noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he was unable to
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:291: way over such rough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:294: search of him, even though he should have to wander a year in those
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:295: mountains before he found him, and so he directed Sancho to take a short
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:296: cut over one side of the mountain, while he himself went by the other,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:305: "It shall be so," said he of the Rueful Countenance, "and I am very glad
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:313: for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money, it is
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:323: suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:331: strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:338: aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He shouted
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:345: he said, "I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:355: knowing why or wherefore."

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:385: tree. He came out to meet us with great gentleness, with his dress now
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:388: recollection we had of them, that he was the person we were looking for.
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:389: He saluted us courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:391: him in order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:392: been imposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:393: never able to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:394: want of food, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:397: not take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:400: he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever night
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:404: we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth, and in

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:423: and fraud above all; and to these he added other words all in effect
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:428: another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these brakes
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:434: which he has crossed our path, at one time to beg the shepherds to give

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:453: along the mountain side, and he was now filled with amazement at what he
/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:455: unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as he had done before,

/h/jtak01/comp15/proj2/test-dirs/smallGutenberg/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/5/9/1/5910/5910.txt:463: that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which he
