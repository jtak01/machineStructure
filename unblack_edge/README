Acknowledgments
        -Multiple TAs during their office hours
        -Collaborated with Eric Duanmu, Alex seto for test cases

Everything has been correctly implemented with proper exit sequences
and without memory leaks

        UArray2.c/.h
                -Able to declare UArray2 and use implemented methods,
                 output of useuarray2 matches with correct_useuarray2
                -Properly frees memory

        Bit2.c/.h
                -Able to declare Bit2 array and use implemented methods,
                 output of usebit2 matches with correct_usebit2
                -Properly frees memory

        sudoku.c
                -Properly identifies correctly solved sudokus 
                 (exits with code 0)
                -Properly identifies incorrectly solved sudokus 
                 (exits with code 1)
                -Handles erroneous input properly 

        unblackedges.c
                -Properly detects and replaces black edges of pbm files
                -Output is formatted to plain pbm format
